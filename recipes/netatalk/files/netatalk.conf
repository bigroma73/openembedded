# Change this to set the machine's atalk name and zone, the latter containing
# the '@' sign as first character -- compare with nbp_name(3) if in doubt
#
# NOTE: If Netatalk should register AppleTalk services in the standard zone
#       then you need not to specify a zone name here.
#
#       If your zone has spaces in it, you're better off specifying
#       it in afpd.conf if you realize that your distribution doesn't
#       handle spaces correctly in the startup script. Remember to use
#       quotes here if the zone name contains spaces.
