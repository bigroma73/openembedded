-AA-lib is a low level gfx library just as many other libraries are. The \
-main difference is that AA-lib does not require graphics device. In fact, \
-there is no graphical output possible. AA-lib replaces those old-fashioned \
-output methods with powerful ascii-art renderer. Now my linux boots \
-with a nice penguin logo at secondary display (yes! Like Win95 does:) \
-AA-lib API is designed to be similar to other graphics libraries. Learning \
-a new API would be a piece of cake! \

-Once upon a time we've (my friend Kamil and I) bought two old Herculeses \
-as secondary monitors. We didn't know for that time that our Diamond \
-Stealths 64 cards would become obsolete soon. Next day we downloaded \
-the logo of Linux Texas Users Group \
-- nice silly penguin looking like a cowboy! It was so exciting logo ... we \
-decided that we couldn't live without it and we wanted to see it every time \
-at a boot time as a logo on our secondary monitors. There was a small problem \
-- Hercules doesn't support color graphics. So we decided to convert an image \
-to ascii art using netpbm tools.

-The output was very ugly because the converting algorithm was absolutly stupid. \
-During the night I designed a new convertor that used a font bitmap for \
-creating aproximation table. The output wasn't very good since the algorithm \
-wasn't so well tuned. Many months this small piece of code was waiting on my \
