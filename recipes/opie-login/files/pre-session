# NOTE about permissions in OpenZaurus
# 	The devices in question here by default
#	are accessible to everyone in the group in
#	question.  We wish to ensure that, as a policy
#	choice, a login to opie makes access to these
#	devices exclusive by 1) changing device ownership
#	to the user, and 2) removing group access.
#
#	A better implementation would probably be to store
#	existing device permissions at load time, and restore
#	them at exit, rather than making assumptions about
#	user/group ownership, or permissions.
