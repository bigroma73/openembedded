# freeze finds all the bitbake files used by the stuff
# currently built in ${TMPDIR}/work and writes those
# files into frozen-bbfiles.conf, then it writes the
# directories containing the files into frozen-packages.conf
#
# The two files define (just) the BBFILES variable.
#
# The path names in the BBFILES variable are of the form:
#
# ${PKGDIR}/packages/directory/bbfile.bb
# ${PKGDIR}/packages/directory/*.bb
#
# as appropriate, directory is the sub-directory of 'packages'.
