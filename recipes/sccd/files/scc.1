.SH NAME
scc \- StorCenter Control Utility
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B scc
\fI[OPTIONS]\fR ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
scc controls the Iomega StorCenter's LED, fan and soft power. It does this 
either by sending a message to the StorCenter Control Daemon, if available, 
or directly communicating with the StorCenter's microcontroller responsible 
for these devices.
.PP
The scc utility  can perform the following functions:
.TP
\fB\fR
The LED can be set to off, blue, red, blue flash, red flash, 
alternate (blue->red->blue) and on some boards alternate3
(blue->blue->blue->red->red->red). The flash and alernate rates 
can be be set. Alternate3 rate is fixed.
.TP
\fB\fR
Fan can be set to on or auto. Auto mode is a thermostat function
that turns the fan on and off based on two temprature settings:
Fan Temp High and Fan Temp Low.
.TP
\fB\fR
The system can be reset, causing a StorCenter reset, or stopped,
causing a full power down.

\fB\-f FAN\fR
control fan operation
.br
FAN=[auto|on]
.TP
\fB\-h TEMP\fR
Hot temp when FAN=auto should go on (0<=TEMP<256)
.TP
\fB\-c TEMP\fR
Cold temp when FAN=auto should go off (0<=TEMP<256)
.SH NOTES
Care should be taken when changing the LED. The boot scripts and the 
.B sccd
daemon use LED colors to indicate boot and disk activity. Changing the LED can
cause some of these functions to be disabled.
