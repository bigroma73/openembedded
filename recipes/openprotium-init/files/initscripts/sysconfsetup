# This script is run once when the system first boots.  Its sole
# purpose is to create /etc/default/sysconf (the overall system
# configuration file) and other files derived from this.
#
# The script runs immediately after S10checkroot.sh - this is the
# point at which the rootfs will be mounted rw even if the kernel
# booted with it ro.
#
# rm or mv the file (/etc/default/sysconf) to recreate it, run this
# script with the reload option to overwrite the system files.  The
# configuration files described in sysconf_reload (in
# /sbin/sysconf) will be overwritten on reload.
#
# start:  standard startup, do a complete (auto) restore if necessary
# reinit: always do a complete auto restore
# reload: just reload sysconf (no config files!)
#
# /etc/default/functions contains useful utility functions - it's
# in a separate file so that it can be loaded by any script
