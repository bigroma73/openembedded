# conffiles
# Known SlugOS configuration files.  These files are preserved on
# a flash upgrade.  Other configuration files, found from:
#
#    /usr/lib/ipkg/*.conffiles
#    /etc/*.conf
#
# are preserved too with an operation of 'diff' if they have been
# changed since /etc/.configured was created.
#
# Lines starting with # are comments, other lines have
# two fields:
#
# operation file 
#
# The file must *NOT* have a leading /
#
# operation may be:
#   ignore    Do not preserve this file
#   preserve  Preserve this file unconditionally
#   diff      Compare file with the new version, ask if different
