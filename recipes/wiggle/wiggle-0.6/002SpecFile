+%description
+Wiggle is a program for applying patches that 'patch' cannot
+apply due to conflicting changes in the original.
+
+Wiggle will always apply all changes in the patch to the original.
+If it cannot find a way to cleanly apply a patch, it inserts it
+in the original in a manner similar to 'merge', and report an
+unresolvable conflict.
