# Bug fix: during the initial boot sysvinit sets PREVLEVEL to
# nothing in rcS and to 'N' in the transition from rcS to the
# user state.  This script runs on that transition and, if
# the PREVLEVEL is 'N', sets 'previous' (as in /etc/init.d/rc)
# to 'S'
if test "$PREVLEVEL" = N
then
	previous=S exec /etc/init.d/zleds stop
fi
exit 0
