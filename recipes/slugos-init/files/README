OpenSlug-1.x Family Release README

Warning:  OpenSlug is not for the faint of heart!  In fact, OpenSlug has a 
specific target audience.

Some background first.  According to the NSLU2 - Linux developers, there are 4
specific types ("camps") of NSLU2 - Linux users:

    Camp #1:    Users who want full Linksys compatibility (including for future
                Linksys firmware releases).  They can load firmware images via
                the Linksys web interface and telnet in - to load Optware - 
                Unslung packages with ipkg, but have no idea what RedBoot is or
                does.
	
    Camp #2:    "Camp #1 Plus users."  They can telnet into RedBoot (ability
                to "self-rescue" a non-working NSLU2), and are comfortable 
                using Linux.

    Camp #3:    Power users!  Firmware flashing via any interface is a walk
                in the park.  They aren't just *users*, but are developers or
                administrators of computers and/or computer software.  
                However, they have no JTAG or custom bootloaders.

    Camp #4:    Bleeding edge users.  They create and use custom bootloaders,
                certainly having no need or desire for Linksys compatibility, 
                modifying and/or changing the hardware as well.

With those camps in mind, OpenSlug is targetted toward Camp #3 and Camp #4
users.  If you're not in Camps 3 & 4, then you should be looking to use the
Unslung firmware.  If you are a Camp #2 user, and still want to use OpenSlug,
you need to practice gaining RedBoot access, and be able to recover from bad
flashes, "drive not formatted" conditions, and other common mistakes/problems
which are documented in the NSLU2-Linux Wiki at http://www.nslu2-linux.org.
Once you are comfortable doing those things, then you may consider using
OpenSlug.

If you're still reading - and still intent on using OpenSlug, click through
the Intel license, download the latest OpenSlug binary and flash it to your
NSLU2!  (Without any HD attached while flashing!!!)  Your next stop should be
the OpenSlug Turnip page at:
