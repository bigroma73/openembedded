# This is an init script for openprotium for storcenter
# 
# This script cleansup after a successful uboot based reflash.
# A uboot reflash is done by changing the bootloader boot command 
# to tftp a flash image and flash the firmware. However the boot command
# is never reset back to a regular boot. This way if the flash did
# not work the next power cycle will cause another reflash. A nice
# development recovery feature. So this boot script is the mechanism
# to reset the uboot boot command. Once booted and access it validated
# this script will issue command to reset the boot command.
#
# This command only has a start so stop is not necessary and should
# as late in the boot process as possible to ensure a successful reboot
# 
# Copy it to /etc/init.d/flashclean and type
#	update-rc.d flashclean start 99 5
