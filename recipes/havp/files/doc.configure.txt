The following items needs to be considered when using havp:

1. Madatory locking

   The filesystem on which SCANTEMPFILE lives must have madatory
   locking enabled (mand option to mount). Note that nfs does not
   support madatory locking.

2. Scanning directory size

   If you have limited space on the SCANTEMPFILE then you will need
   to set MAXSCANSIZE.

3. Transparent proxy

   For transparent proxying you need an IP tables rule such as:

     iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i eth0 -p tcp -m tcp --dport 80 -j REDIRECT --to-ports 8080

   where eth0 is the incomming port, and 8080 is the port that havp
   is running on.
