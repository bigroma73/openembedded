# Default per-machine config
# DO NOT CHANGE THIS
# Create a new file ${MACHINE}/uClibc.distro
# Use this file for information which is specific to the machine,
# as opposed to the architecture (e.g. nslu2 as opposed to armeb or arm)
# KISS: this file gets includes last, nothing in here can be
# overridden.  Restrict things in here to things which are absolutely
# and certainly true for this machine.
