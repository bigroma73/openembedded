DESCRIPTION = "TLS Lite is a free python library that implements SSL 3.0 and TLS 1.0. TLS Lite supports non-traditional \
authentication methods such as SRP, shared keys, and cryptoIDs, in addition to X.509 certificates. TLS Lite is pure  \
Python, however it can access OpenSSL or cryptlib for faster crypto operations."
