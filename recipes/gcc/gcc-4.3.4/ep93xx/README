This is a set of patches for gcc-4.3 that fix code generation for the
Maverick Crunch FPU present in Cirrus Logic EP93xx devices.

They are based on the patch ideas for OpenEmbedded that Hasjim Williams sent me
privately in April 2008, with my own reimplementation of the CCMAV mode and the
addition of a -mieee switch to fully respect denormalized values (with a 50%
speed penalty).

See the comments at the top of each patch file for further details.
