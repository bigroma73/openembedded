# This is generic pppd config for GPRS connection
# To connect to specific provider, one
# more provider-specific config
# file is required, which will 
# usually just set chat utility params 
# to make connection and call this one. 
# (And in most cases that will be symlink 
# to a file with well-known settings).
#
# Usage:
#   pppd <modem_device> call gprs call <country>-<provider>
#   where /etc/ppp/peers/<country>-<provider> ends with line
#   "call _gprs"
# Example:
#   pppd /dev/rfcomm0 call ua-life
# Debugging PPP protocol problems:
#   pppd /dev/rfcomm0 call ua-life debug nodetach
#
# By default, pppd will go to 
# background once connection is 
# established. 'nodetach' option will 
# prevent this. If you want pppd to
# even establish connection in 
# background, comment 'updetach' below.
# 
# To finish connection, use Ctrl+C if
# 'nodetach' was used, or
#   kill `head -1 /var/run/ppp-gprs.pid`
# otherwise. If you are sure there is
# only one pppd connection, you can use
#   killall pppd

##
## pppd options
##

# create /var/run/ppp-gprs.pid 
# with pid for this connection
linkname gprs
# Connect in foreground, but go 
# to background after that
updetach
