.TH serload 1 19.08.2001 Distribution "SIMpad Serial Download"
.SH NAME
serload - Downloading a new image to the SIMpad

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B serload
.I [IMAGEFILENAME] [ttyS-PORT]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B serload 
downloads a new image to the SIMpad using 
the serial port. You need to connect the SIMpad 
to your PC with the delivered serial crossover cable 
and execute 
.B serload 
with the image name as parameter. 
As an optional parameter, you can provide the serial port 
for 
.B serload 
to use, otherwise, /dev/ttyS0 is assumed as 
default. 
.B serload 
will ask you to reset the SIMpad to 
download the new image. Depending on the image, it will 
be burnt into the Flash or directly executed in the 
RAM without burning.
.P
You can update the operating system, 
the firmware (PBL), and the bootloader with this utility. Updating 
the bootloader needs two steps: 1st downloading/burning 
a special bootloader (the so-called alternativ bootloader), 
2nd downloading/burning the new bootloader.
