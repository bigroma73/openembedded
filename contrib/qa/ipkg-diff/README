A Small utility to diff two directories of Itsy Packages.

This utility will take two directories hopefully containing
Itsy Packages (ipk) and compare the ipks. It will find deleted
and new packages but will also compare packages with the same
name. And check file types, sizes, control files. And one time
it will be able to find upgrades and scan them as well.

(this script is meant to be hacky, hacky, hacky and to do the
 job)

The only pattern applied is a Anti-Pattern: Time pressure
